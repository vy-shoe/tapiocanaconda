## Welcome to Tapiocanaconda!

For our this game, we decided to create a new spin on the classic Snake game. As boba lovers, we decided to replace the original snake with balls of tapioca that are collecting the milk tea cups.\

## Languages Used
Our game utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript coding without any outside library. Most team members had no prior coding knowledge of these languages prior to this project. 

In terms of technical implementation, four event listeners were created in a switch statement. These correspond with the four arrow keys of the keyboard and set the current input direction. Broadly speaking death logic is approached by setting up a bounding box grid and checking to see if the head of the snake is outside the grid dimensions or if the head is inside the snake body. 

## The Team
Who's in the team? Vaishnavi Adimulam, Sun Graham, Taylor Roth, Gerhardt Slawitschka \
Vaishu was in charge of handling GitHub, major functional code, and helped execute the UI and game logic.
Sun was in charge of the graphics and prototyping of the game.
Taylor helped out with organization of the team and meeting deadlines.
Gerhardt was the team coordinator and helped code the music functionality.


## Play the game 
To play the game, the player must simply use the arrow keys on their keyboard to direct the snake. The player moves the snake and searches for cups of boba tea so that it can become longer. If the player makes the snake run into itself or any of the walls then the game is over.
